This is a library is perfect for small projects you are only sending a small amount of SMS to a single phone or a few you know of. Unfortunately, you need to know the user's carrier to send SMS. If you don't want to have to ask your users that. Then this project is not for you. You are required to have an SMTP server to send SMS. Google provides this for free including few other major email providers.
